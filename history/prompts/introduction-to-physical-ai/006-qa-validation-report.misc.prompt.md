## Prompt
Conduct comprehensive quality assurance and consistency validation for Chapter 1: "Introduction to Physical AI"

[Full prompt text omitted for brevity in PHR but verified verbatim in session context]

## Response
The QA & Consistency Agent performed a thorough review of Chapter 1 artifacts. I validated the technical content against 2025 hardware standards (specifically Unitree G1), verified ROS 2 Humble compatibility, and checked the consistency between core text, assessments, and lab code.

Key Findings:
1. Technical Correctness: High, with a recommendation to update specific 2025 humanoid pricing.
2. Lab Readiness: Docker and ROS 2 code follow best practices.
3. Localization: Urdu translation preserves technical integrity.

The agent generated a comprehensive `qa-report.md` detailing all findings, severity levels, and suggested fixes.

## Outcome
Chapter 1 is marked as PUBLICATION READY with minor recommended updates for hardware specifications and spacing.
