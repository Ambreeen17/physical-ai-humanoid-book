## Response
I have created the personalized content variants for Chapter 1: "Introduction to Physical AI".

1. Created `C:/boook/specs/chapter1/personalization.md` containing Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced variants for sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4.
2. Created `C:/boook/specs/chapter1/personalization_config.json` containing the metadata for runtime adaptation (reading times, difficulties, prerequisites).
3. Created `C:/boook/specs/chapter1/personalization_component.jsx` as a prototype React component for toggling between profile views.

## Outcome
Chapter 1 now has a complete set of adaptive learning content ready for Docusaurus integration. The variants address different learner backgrounds ranging from non-technical beginners to research-oriented advanced students.
