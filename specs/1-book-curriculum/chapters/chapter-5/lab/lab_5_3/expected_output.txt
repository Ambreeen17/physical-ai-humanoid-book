# Expected Output for lab_5_3

## Expected Results

When running the lab_5_3 node, you should see output similar to:

```
[INFO] [12345.789]: Advanced Computer Vision for Robotics - Integration and Optimization node initialized
[INFO] [12345.790]: Received joint states: N joints
[INFO] [12345.791]: Processing Computer Vision for Robotics data
```

## Validation Criteria

Your implementation should:
1. Successfully subscribe to joint_states topic
2. Process Computer Vision for Robotics data correctly
3. Publish results to lab_5_3/result topic
4. Handle edge cases appropriately
5. Maintain real-time performance requirements

## Performance Benchmarks

- Processing rate: >10 Hz
- Memory usage: <100 MB
- CPU usage: <20% on typical hardware

## Common Issues

1. **Topic not found**: Ensure ROS nodes are in the same domain
2. **Performance issues**: Optimize algorithms for real-time execution
3. **Integration errors**: Check message type compatibility
