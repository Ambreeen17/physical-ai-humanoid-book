## Detailed Analysis

### Content Quality
The content quality assessment checks for:
- Clarity and coherence of explanations
- Proper use of technical terminology
- Logical flow between sections
- Consistency in style and formatting

### Learning Objectives Alignment
Each learning objective should be adequately covered in the chapter content:
- LO1: Implement sampling-based motion planning algorithms (PRM, RRT, RRT*)
- LO2: Apply optimization-based planning methods (CHOMP, STOMP, TrajOpt)
- LO3: Design real-time replanning systems for dynamic environments
- LO4: Integrate perception and planning for obstacle avoidance
- LO5: Evaluate planning performance in terms of completeness, optimality, and efficiency

### Hardware Accuracy
Hardware specifications should match current 2025 standards, particularly for the Unitree G1 robot and associated sensors/actuators.

### Code Validity
Code examples should follow ROS 2 Humble best practices and be executable in the provided lab environment.

## Pass/Fail Criteria
