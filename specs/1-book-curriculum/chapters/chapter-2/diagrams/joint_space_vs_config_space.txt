                    Physical Interpretation
                    =======================

    Joint Space (unconstrained):
    ---------------------------
          q1 axis: [-180, +180] degrees (full rotation)
          q2 axis: [-180, +180] degrees (full rotation)

    Configuration Space (with limits):
    ---------------------------------
          q1 axis: [-120, +120] degrees (limited by shoulder)
          q2 axis: [-150, +150] degrees (limited by elbow)

    C-Space Shape:
    - Unconstrained: Torus (n-dimensional)
    - Constrained: Hyper-rectangle with collision cutouts

    ============================================================

    Unitree G1 Arm (6-DOF):
    ----------------------
          q = [q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6]^T

          Joint Space: R^6 (6-dimensional real space)
          Configuration Space: Bounded subset of R^6

          Dimension: 6
          Shape: 6D hyper-rectangle with constraints

### Description for Docusaurus

**Alt Text:**
Diagram showing the relationship between joint space, configuration space, and workspace for robot manipulators. Joint space is the full n-dimensional space of joint angles; configuration space is the constrained subset with joint limits applied; workspace shows reachable end-effector positions.

**Caption:**
Joint space represents all possible joint angle combinations, while configuration space (C-space) constrains this with physical limits. The Unitree G1's 6-DOF arm has a 6-dimensional joint space but a bounded configuration space due to joint limits and collision avoidance.

**Explanation:**
The diagram illustrates three fundamental spaces in robotics. Joint space is the n-dimensional space where each axis represents one joint angle; for the Unitree G1 arm, this is R^6. Configuration space (C-space) constrains joint space with physical limits—for revolute joints with limits, C-space becomes a bounded region. The workspace describes reachable end-effector positions, which is the image of C-space under forward kinematics. A key insight is that the mapping from C-space to workspace is many-to-one: multiple configurations can reach the same end-effector position (e.g., elbow-up vs elbow-down poses).
