# Chapter 2 Labs: Kinematics & Dynamics

This directory contains lab exercises for Chapter 2: Kinematics & Dynamics.

## Lab Overview

The labs in this chapter focus on practical implementation of Kinematics & Dynamics concepts using the Unitree G1 robot and ROS 2 Humble.

## Labs Included

1. **Lab 2.1**: Introduction to Kinematics & Dynamics - Basic Concepts
2. **Lab 2.2**: Intermediate Kinematics & Dynamics - Implementation
3. **Lab 2.3**: Advanced Kinematics & Dynamics - Integration and Optimization

## Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose
- Basic ROS 2 knowledge
- Understanding of Kinematics & Dynamics theory (Chapter 2)

## Getting Started

Each lab has its own directory with:
- Dockerfile for the lab environment
- ROS 2 nodes implementing Kinematics & Dynamics concepts
- Launch files for easy execution
- Documentation and assessment criteria
