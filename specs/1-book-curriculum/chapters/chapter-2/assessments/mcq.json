      "question": "What does a singularity in a robot manipulator mean?",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "points": 2,
      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.1"],
      "tags": ["kinematics", "singularities", "joint_space"],
      "options": [
        "A) When the robot runs out of battery",
        "B) When the Jacobian loses rank, losing a degree of freedom",
        "C) When the robot is perfectly balanced",
        "D) When joint angles are zero"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A singularity occurs when the manipulator's Jacobian matrix loses rank, meaning it becomes non-invertible. At singular configurations, the robot loses one or more degrees of freedom and cannot move in certain Cartesian directions, even though the joints can still move. This is a fundamental concept in robot kinematics that students must understand for safe operation."

      "question": "Which DH parameter represents joint rotation?",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "points": 2,
      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.2"],
      "tags": ["DH_parameters", "forward_kinematics"],
      "options": [
        "a) theta - joint angle",
        "b) d - link length",
        "c) a - link offset",
        "d) alpha - twist angle"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, theta (theta) represents the joint angle - the variable that changes when a revolute joint rotates. The other parameters are: d (link offset), a (link length), and alpha (twist angle). Understanding DH parameters is essential for forward kinematics computation."

      "question": "The configuration space (C-space) of a robot manipulator includes:",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 2,
      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.1"],
      "tags": ["configuration_space", "joint_space", "workspace"],
      "options": [
        "A) Only the end-effector positions",
        "B) All possible joint angle combinations",
        "C) Only reachable positions in Cartesian space",
        "D) The joint velocities only"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The configuration space (C-space) is the set of all possible robot configurations, represented by all possible joint angle combinations. This differs from the workspace, which is only the set of reachable end-effector positions. Understanding C-space is crucial for motion planning and collision avoidance."

      "question": "A homogeneous transformation matrix is a 4x4 matrix that represents:",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "points": 2,
      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.2"],
      "tags": ["homogeneous_transformations", "forward_kinematics"],
      "options": [
        "A) Only the rotation of a coordinate frame",
        "B) Only the translation of a coordinate frame",
        "C) Both rotation and translation in a single representation",
        "D) Only the joint angles of the robot"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A homogeneous transformation matrix combines both rotation and translation into a single 4x4 matrix representation. The upper-left 3x3 is the rotation matrix, and the last column is the translation vector. This compact representation enables efficient chaining of transformations: T_total = T1 * T2 * ... * Tn."

      "id": "ch2_mcq_005",
      "question": "In Lagrangian mechanics, the Lagrangian L is defined as:",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",

      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.4"],
      "tags": ["lagrangian_mechanics", "dynamics"],
      "options": [
        "A) L = T + V (Kinetic + Potential energy)",
        "B) L = T - V (Kinetic - Potential energy)",
        "C) L = T * V (Product of energies)",
        "D) L = V - T (Potential - Kinetic energy)"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Lagrangian is defined as L = T - V, where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy. This formulation leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation: d/dt(∂L/∂q̇) - ∂L/∂q = τ, which is used to derive equations of motion for robot manipulators."

      "learning_objectives": ["LO2.3"],
      "tags": ["inverse_kinematics", "numerical_methods", "jacobian"],
      "options": [
        "A) It always finds the exact solution in one step",
        "B) It uses iterative methods to converge toward a solution",
        "C) It only works for 2-DOF manipulators",
        "D) It does not require Jacobian computation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Numerical IK methods like Jacobian pseudo-inverse and damped least squares are iterative approaches that gradually converge toward a solution. They are essential for 6-DOF+ manipulators where analytical solutions may not exist. Convergence depends on initial guess, gain tuning, and avoiding singularities."
