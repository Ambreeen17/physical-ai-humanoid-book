  # Question 1: DH Parameters - Foundational
  - id: ch2_mcq_001
    question: |
      In the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention for robot manipulators, which parameter
      represents the length of the link along the axis perpendicular to both joint axes?
    difficulty: foundational
    points: 5
    learning_objectives: [LO2.2]
    topic: DH_parameters
    options:
      - label: A
        text: "theta (theta) - the joint angle"
        is_correct: false
      - label: B
        text: "d - the link offset"
        is_correct: false
      - label: C
        text: "a - the link length"
        is_correct: true
      - label: D
        text: "alpha - the link twist angle"
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      In the DH convention:
      - theta (theta) is the joint angle, which varies for revolute joints
      - d is the link offset, which varies for prismatic joints
      - a (alpha) is the link length, the perpendicular distance between joint axes
      - alpha is the twist angle, the angle between joint axes

      The link length 'a' is the constant geometric property describing how far apart
      the joint axes are in space, measured along the common normal.

  # Question 2: Singularities - Foundational
  - id: ch2_mcq_002
    question: |
      At a kinematic singularity of a robot manipulator, what happens to the Jacobian matrix?
    difficulty: foundational
    points: 5
    learning_objectives: [LO2.1, LO2.2]
    topic: singularities
    options:
      - label: A
        text: "The Jacobian becomes a square identity matrix"
        is_correct: false
      - label: B
        text: "The Jacobian loses rank and becomes non-invertible"
        is_correct: true
      - label: C
        text: "The Jacobian determinant becomes exactly 1"
        is_correct: false
      - label: D
        text: "The Jacobian becomes zero (all elements equal 0)"
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      At a singularity, the Jacobian matrix loses rank, meaning its determinant becomes
      zero and it can no longer be inverted. This means:
      - Some Cartesian directions cannot be achieved (loss of DOF)
      - Infinite joint velocities would be required to move in certain directions
      - The manipulator "loses a degree of freedom" in terms of Cartesian control

      This is why singularities must be avoided in trajectory planning.

  # Question 3: Workspace - Intermediate
  - id: ch2_mcq_003
    question: |
      A 2-DOF planar arm has link lengths L1 = 0.5m and L2 = 0.3m. What is the
      maximum reachable distance from the base (i.e., the maximum radius of the reachable workspace)?
    difficulty: intermediate
    points: 5
    learning_objectives: [LO2.1]
    topic: workspace
    options:
      - label: A
        text: "0.3m"
        is_correct: false
      - label: B
        text: "0.5m"
        is_correct: false
      - label: C
        text: "0.8m (L1 + L2)"
        is_correct: true
      - label: D
        text: "0.2m (L1 - L2)"
        is_correct: false
      - label: E
        text: "1.0m"
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      For a 2-DOF planar arm, the reachable workspace is an annular region (ring-shaped):
      - Maximum reach = L1 + L2 = 0.5m + 0.3m = 0.8m (when both links extend straight)
      - Minimum reach = |L1 - L2| = |0.5m - 0.3m| = 0.2m (when one folds back)

      Points within this range (0.2m to 0.8m) are reachable in some configurations.

  # Question 4: Lagrangian Dynamics - Advanced
  - id: ch2_mcq_004
    question: |
      In the Euler-Lagrange equation d/dt(dL/dq_dot) - dL/dq = tau, what does 'q'
      represent, and how does it differ from the Cartesian position 'x'?
    difficulty: advanced
    points: 5
    learning_objectives: [LO2.4]
    topic: lagrangian_dynamics
    options:
      - label: A
        text: "q is the joint velocity; x is the joint position"
        is_correct: false
      - label: B
        text: "q is the Cartesian position of the end-effector"
        is_correct: false
      - label: C
        text: "q is the vector of joint angles/positions; x is the end-effector pose in Cartesian space"
        is_correct: true
      - label: D
        text: "q and x are equivalent representations"
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      In robotics:
      - q = [q1, q2, ..., qn] is the joint space configuration (joint angles or positions)
      - x = [x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw] is the Cartesian space pose (end-effector position/orientation)

      The relationship is given by forward kinematics: x = f(q)

      The Lagrangian L = T(q, q_dot) - V(q) is expressed in joint space, while the
      equation of motion tau = M(q)*q_ddot + C(q, q_dot)*q_dot + g(q) gives joint torques.
