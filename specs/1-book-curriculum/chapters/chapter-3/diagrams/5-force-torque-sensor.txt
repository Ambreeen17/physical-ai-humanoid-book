    CALIBRATION MATRIX:

        F_raw = C * V_raw

        Where C is a 6xN calibration matrix (N = number of strain gauges)

        Typically C is determined by applying known forces and torques
        and solving least squares: C = F_known * V_raw^T * (V_raw * V_raw^T)^-1

    FORCE/TORQUE RESOLUTION:
    =======================

        F_z Resolution = (Strain Gauge Sensitivity) * (Amplifier Gain) / A/D bits

        Typical values:
            - Force resolution: 0.1 - 1 N
            - Torque resolution: 0.01 - 0.1 Nm
            - Sampling rate: 100 - 1000 Hz
