      "sample_model_answer": "The accelerometer and gyroscope provide complementary measurements that, when combined through sensor fusion, overcome individual sensor limitations. The accelerometer measures proper acceleration including the gravity vector, allowing determination of orientation relative to the vertical, but it is sensitive to linear accelerations (not just orientation) and produces noisy readings. The gyroscope measures angular velocity, which can be integrated to track orientation changes smoothly in the short term, but it suffers from drift errors that accumulate over time. By fusing these sensors using algorithms like complementary filters or Kalman filters, we can use the accelerometer's gravity reference to correct gyroscope drift while using the gyroscope's smooth rate measurements to filter out accelerometer noise from linear motion. This results in accurate, drift-free orientation estimates for robot navigation."
