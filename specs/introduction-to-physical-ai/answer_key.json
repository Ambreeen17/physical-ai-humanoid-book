    "1.1": {
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "VLA models are trained on sensorimotor data (vision + language + action), allowing them to output physical actions, unlike text-only LLMs."
    },
    "1.2": {
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ignoring physics increases the gap. Effective strategies include System ID and Domain Randomization."
    },
    "1.3": {
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Topics are named buses for many-to-many asynchronous communication in ROS 2."
    }
