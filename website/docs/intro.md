# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI-native textbook for **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This comprehensive curriculum teaches embodied intelligence through theory, hands-on labs, and progressive challenges.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers:
- **Embodied Intelligence**: How robots learn through interaction with the physical world
- **Simulation-to-Real Transfer**: Bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment
- **Humanoid Platforms**: Hardware from research prototypes to commercial deployments
- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: The industry-standard middleware for robotics
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: End-to-end learning for robotic control
- **Capstone Project**: Design and deploy a complete autonomous system

## Course Structure

Each chapter includes:
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Deep explanations grounded in physics and AI research
- **Hands-On Labs**: Simulated robotics using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Assessments**: Quizzes, coding challenges, and project rubrics
- **Personalized Learning**: Content adapts to your background (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

## Prerequisites

- **Software Engineering**: Python fundamentals (loops, functions, classes)
- **Basic Robotics**: No prior robotics experience required
- **Math**: High school algebra and basic trigonometry
- **Tools**: Docker, command-line familiarity helpful but not required

## How to Use This Textbook

1. **Read the chapter**: Start with the theoretical sections to build intuition
2. **Study diagrams**: Visual explanations clarify complex concepts
3. **Complete the lab**: Hands-on coding cements your understanding
4. **Answer assessments**: Tests validate your learning
5. **Attempt challenges**: Extend concepts to new problems
